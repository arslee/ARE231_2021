## Intro

- Research requires many things.
- Coding is a not sufficient but necessary and essential skill set for research.
- Curse of abundance
  * Data
  * Programming Languages
  * Methodologies
- Too much information is no information

So, where should we go and how?

## What was your coding experience like ?

## Mindsets
- Focus on positive experiences
- Keep making small achievements
- No one is born a programmer
- Do you know how to use Google? Then you are ready to become a good programmer

## Coding
- Coding is more than executing things with some lines of code.
- It encompasses general workflows
  * folder/file management
  * documentation
  * version control
  
- Some important qualities are
  * readability
  * modifiability
  * reproducibility
  * efficiency (space + time)


## Things you need to know when using R
- R has multiple packages that do similar things.
  * Different packages might have very different syntax styles.
  * e.g., `base` vs `tidyverse` vs `data.table` ([*nice summary here*](https://mgimond.github.io/rug_2019_12/Index.html#subsetting-by-variable-values))
  * In the first session, I stick to `tidyverse` style. In the second session, I will use `data.table` style.

- Some packages are more reliable than others.
  * Do some research or play around with it when you start using a new package especially if not widely used.
