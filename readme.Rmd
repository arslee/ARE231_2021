This repository contains codes, slides, and other documents that I have
used for a crash course on applied economics research using R. The
course is taught in ARE231-Agricultural Demand and Supply, a 2nd-year
PhD course at UC Davis. ARE231 is taught jointly by Aaron Smith and
Timothy Beatty. As a guest lecturer, I held two sessions, each of which
took around one and half hours.

In the first session, I covered coding mindset, useful features of
Rstudio, short-cuts, snippets and project setup. Before the session, I
have asked students to do a mini empirical research project using R
(please see at the end of this document). I walked through my workflow
and codes for the mini project.

In the second session, I taught how to use R for spatial data analysis.
I spent about an hour about how to use R as a GIS tool. In the last half
hour, I went through how to construct cropland-weighted county-level
temperature data using weather data from the PRISM and landcover data
from National Land Cover Database (NLCD).

We are going to run the following panel regression of crop yields for
corn and soybeans in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana over the period
1981-2019:

$$ log(y_{cit})=\beta_{c1}prec_{it}+\beta_{c2}prec_{it}^2+\beta_{c3}gdd_{it}+\beta_{c4}hdd_{it}+ \alpha_i+f_i(t)+\epsilon_{cit},$$

where $y_{cit}$ denotes the yield for crop $c$ in county $i$ in year
$t$. $prec$ denotes precipitation, and $gdd$ represents beneficial heat
exposure (Growing Degree Days: degree days between 10C and 30C) and
$hdd$ represents harmful heat exposure (Heating Degree Days: degree days
above 30C). We include county fixed effects $\alpha_{i}$ and
county-specific time trend $f_{i}(t)$. The growing season for corn and
soybeans in the three I states is approximately from April to September.

This crop yield model has become popular in the literature since the
seminar work by [Schlenker and Roberts
(2009)](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.short). You will learn
more about the methodology and other related ones later in the course in
more detail.

**I do encourage you to spend some time trying to implement the
following steps**, although I will walk through them in the session

It is totally ok even if you do not make much progress. But, I would
like you to at least try each step so that you can make most out of my
session.

1.  Download annual county-level yield and acreage data for corn (for
    grain) and soybeans for all counties in the I states from the USDA
    NASS quickstats for the period 1981-2019. (Note: There are multiple
    ways of doing this. I would like your workflow to be reproducible
    and automated, meaning that executing your script downloads all data
    you need at once. Please feel free to refer to [Accessing Ag Data
    Using R](https://asmith.ucdavis.edu/data/meta))

2.  Download weather data by clicking `Download All Monthly Data` from
    [US County Weather](https://asmith.ucdavis.edu/data/weather) once
    the app is fully loaded. (In a few weeks later, we are going to
    learn how to construct this data using the gridded daily temperature
    data from the PRISM Climate Group, county boundaries, and crop
    frequency map)

3.  Using the data you downloaded, create a crop-county-year level panel
    dataset that contains columns of yield and weather variables
    necessary for your regressions. This will involve some data
    cleaning. (Tip: You can construct annual $gdd$ or $hdd$ by summing
    monthly degree days over the growing season (April to September))

4.  Before running regressions, do some data exploration to check your
    data. You can compare your data with [US
    Crops](https://asmith.ucdavis.edu/data/us-crops).

5.  Run regressions for the following combinations.

    -   crop : 1) corn, 2) soybeans

    -   period : 1) full (1981-2019), 2) pre 2000 (1981-2000), 3) post
        2000 (2001-2019),

    -   regression weights : 1) no weight, 2) acreage

    -   cluster standard errors by: 1) year, 2) state

    -   time trend : 1) county-specific linear, 2) state-specific
        linear, 3) county-specific quadratic, 4) state-specific
        quadratic

    -   weather variables : 1) (with precipitation) $prec$, $prec^2$,
        $gdd$ and $hdd$, 2) (without precipitation) $gdd$ and $hdd$

That is, you have $2\times 3\times 2 \times 2\times 4\times 2 = 192$
regression results.

6.  Let's focus on $\beta_4$.

    -   Obtain $\hat{\beta}_4$s and calculate their confidence
        intervals.
    -   Compare $\hat{\beta}_4$s and their confidence intervals by
        changing one dimension at a time. (i.e., compare
        $\hat{\beta}_4$s for different crops 1) corn and 2) soybeans
        while keeping 1) for all the other dimensions).
    -   Do you find any systematic differences between models in any
        dimensions? If so, what are they? Are they consistent with your
        intuition?
